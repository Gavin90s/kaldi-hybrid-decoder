# kaldi-hybrid-decoder
In Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR), decoder is either static(based on Weighted Finite State Transducer) or dynamic(based on History Conditioned Word Prefix-Tree/Graph).  This project provides a unified approach in Kaldi's framework, extending its decoder for more application scenarios.
